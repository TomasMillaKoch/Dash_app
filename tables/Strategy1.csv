1.1,Remediate crossings that are acting as barriers,"This action represents some projects that would be led by the planning team with conservation funds (e.g., orphaned barriers or those owned by individuals), while other remediation projects would be the responsibility of the barrier owner. Industry will have to be engaged to successfully implement this intervention. 

PSC Southern Boundary Restoration and Enhancement Fund proposal:

- Complete remediation of one priority barrier, including engineering designs

HCTF proposal:

- Complete remediation of one priority barrier

CNFASAR proposal (2022-26):

- Complete remediation of one priority barrier per year for four years

HRR Can help with finding local people to implement remediation projects.

1.2,Lobby that the government enforce their regulations,"This can apply to both provincial and federal governments. For example, advocating for increased discretionary decisions to remove barriers to fish. One action could be to submit barrier assessment data to show proof that regulations are not being followed.",Very high,High,Effective
1.3,Initiate a barrier owner outreach program for locations on the barrier remediation shortlist,"Work with landowners / users (e.g., ATV groups) to identify and remediate their aquatic barriers. Education component can help prevent barriers in the first place. HRR to reach out to owners of confirmed barriers to discuss remediation options; CWF to reach out to provincial representatives.",Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.4,Knowledge Gap: Continue updating the barrier prioritization model,The model has been updated to reflect 2021 field assessments and intermediate barrier review.,Very high,High,Effective
1.5,Knowledge Gap: conduct field assessments on updated preliminary barrier list using the provincial fish passage framework and update connectivity goal if additional barriers are added to the barrier remediation shortlist,Twenty-six field assessments performed in 2021.,Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.6,Update longitudinal connectivity goal if additional barriers are added to the barrier remediation shortlist,,,,
1.7,Knowledge Gap: Identify and map crossing ownership,For barriers on the barrier remediation shortlist.,Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.8,Knowledge Gap: Compile road maintenance schedules,"Ground-truthing is important, as the schedules do not always reflect what happens in the field.",High,High,Effective
1.9,Knowledge Gap: Survey trail-stream crossings to confirm low pressure rating values,Need to access detailed trail maps in the watershed to prioritize our time and resources. This should be accomplished as people are out surveying for other reasons rather than spending time and resources specifically to fill this knowledge gap.,Very high,Medium,Need more information
,,CNFASAR proposal:,,,
,,Collaborate with WLFN to:,,,
,,"- Develop field assessment protocols for whether ATV trail stream crossings pass fish, and for assessing other effects on fish habitat ",,,
,,- Map potential trail-stream crossings on salmon habitat that could be assessed ,,,
,,"- Assess 30-50 trail stream crossings, record measurements, and take pictures",,,
